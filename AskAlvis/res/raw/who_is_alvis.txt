Who is Alvis?

Alvis is a character that appears in Norse mythology.  'Alvis' means 'all wise' in Old Norse.  According to the legend Alvis was the name of a dwarf who was to marry Thor's daughter, Thrud.  Thor was not pleased with this so he tricked Alvis by asking him questions until the sun rose, at which time the dwarf was turned to stone.

Is what the legend doesn't mention (cause I made this part up) is that after Alvis was turned to stone he was taken, crushed into powder and put into a lamp.  A spell was cast upon the lamp so that when someone seeking knowledge rubbed the lamp Alvis would appear to answer questions that could be answered with either yes or no.

FAQ
If Alvis is all knowing how did he not know that Thor was tricking him?
-Although Alvis was a dwarf he still had an ego.  All through the night Thor made him feel very smart by asking questions that only an all wise being could answer.  So in his absorption in his own ego he did not consider that he was being tricked.

Isn't it inhumane to keep Alvis inside of a lamp?
-Don't worry.  I inspected the inside of Alvis' lamp and found that it is very comfortable.  There is a space time distortion that was part of the spell cast that has allowed enough space inside the lamp for a 52in flat screen, King sized bed and even a jacuzzi.  Alvis is very happy inside of his lamp (just look at his smile!) and he wouldn't have it any other way.

Does Alvis really know what he is talking about?
-Probably not, but it's still fun!
